5. Online Movie Review System

Develop a simple movie review app.

MongoDB: reviews collection with fields: username, movieName, rating, comment.

Express.js: API to add review & fetch reviews.

Angular:

Form with required rating (1â€“5)

Show all reviews in a table with average rating calculation



While this can be done trivially to learn something new i modified the question
a bit and have implemented many new backend apis
existing apis asked:
    add a review api - addReview
    fetch all reviews api - viewAllReviews
added by me:
    fetch movies and get average rating api - viewReviewsByMovies
    fetch only a particular movie reviews api - viewReviewsByMovies/:movie
